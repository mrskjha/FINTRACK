## Technologies & Tools
### **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**
- TensorFlow / Scikit-learn – Predictive analytics, financial risk assessment, and expense tracking.

- NLP (Natural Language Processing) – Personalized recommendations and user query analysis.

### **Blockchain & Security**
- Ethereum / Hyperledger Fabric – Decentralized, secure financial transactions.
- Smart Contracts – Automate savings, investments, and lending agreements securely.

## How Our Solution Stands Out
Unlike existing platforms such as Khatabook, our financial management system provides:
- **AI-powered automation** rather than manual expense tracking.
- **Blockchain security** instead of centralized databases vulnerable to breaches.
- **Gamification and interactive financial learning** to enhance user engagement.
- **Automated wealth management** with real-time investment tracking.
- **Seamless API integrations** with banks and financial institutions.
